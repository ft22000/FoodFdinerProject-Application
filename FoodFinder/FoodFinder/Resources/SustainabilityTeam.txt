The University of Tasmania Sustainability Mission Statement:

Universities have a vital and unique role to play in sustainable forms of development based upon principles of justice, prudence, stewardship, collaboration and diversity.
At the University of Tasmania we believe sustainability is central to the higher education mission of free inquiry and social learning.
We strive to embody sustainable ways of living within the university and to enable pathways towards sustainability in Tasmania and around the world.
We empower the University’s students and staff to be leaders in their fields while contributing to sustainability in their personal and professional lives.
Sustainable practices are embedded within university operations and staff training through the University’s commitment to reduce environmental impacts, achieve economic efficiency, demonstrate social responsibility and enhance student experience.
With sustainability embedded across the curriculum, the University’s teachers foster intellectual rigor and agility, allowing all students to develop knowledge and skills for sustainability through disciplinary breadth of choice and cross-disciplinary innovation.  
Building upon the University’s world class research in the areas of environment and health, the University’s researchers create and apply knowledge to meet economic, environmental, social and cultural challenges of sustainability. 
Aware of the University’s responsibility to provide independent, visionary and informed social leadership, we engage with decision-makers, professions and communities in the task of making possible more sustainable ways of living.
